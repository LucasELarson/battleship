# This is a battleship game with an AI

In order to play follow these steps:

1: Place your ship squares on the left board (there is a randomly generated number above that board telling you how many need to be placed)
2: When the text above your board says "READY TO START" hit the start button above the right side board.
3: Now place your shots on the right side board. When you or the ai has hit all ships you win or lose. Note that the ai has the same number of ships as you.
3.5: When you click the enemy board a yellow is a miss and a green is a hit. When the AI hits your board a yellow is a miss and a red is a hit.
